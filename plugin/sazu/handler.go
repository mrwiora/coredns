	//     content) always carries a complete fresh replacement of
	//     everything it serves, but never emits deletes for anything
	//     it's dropped since the last push, so without a purge first a
	//     removed record would linger forever. PurgeContent clears every
	//     ordinary RRset (DNSKEY excepted -- key management is
	//     independent of content) and the NSEC/NSEC3 chain along with
	//     it, then applies every op in zoneOps -- all under one lock
	//     acquisition (ZoneData.PurgeContentAndApply), so a concurrent
	//     query can never observe the zone in between with a record
	//     transiently missing that both existed a moment before this
	//     push and will exist again a moment after it.
	//   - Anything else that changes ordinary zone content invalidates
	//     the existing chain's correctness about that content -- purge
	//     just the chain (PurgeNSEC) rather than risk serving a
	//     stale/incorrect proof; this can't drop content itself (it
	//     isn't a full replacement), so PurgeContent would be wrong
	//     here. Nothing sazuctl builds can reach this case today
	//     (publish-zone is the only command that ever changes ordinary
	//     content, and it's always a full push), but the protocol itself
	//     doesn't forbid a different, arbitrary SIG(0)-signed client from
	//     sending a partial content change -- purging the chain is the
	//     only safe response to one, since nothing here validates that
	//     such a push's own chain-shaped records (if it included any)
	//     are actually a correct, complete replacement.
	//
	// A first-contact/publish-trust push, a KSK rollover, or a ZSK
	// add/retire carries an apex DNSKEY but changes no other served
	// content, so it matches neither case here and both the chain and
