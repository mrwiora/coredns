// never "a customer locked out of their own zone," and there is no
// operational reason yet to persist what is purely an abuse/churn guard

// name a caller has attempted (even a first-contact attempt that never
// verified, since garbage zone names are free to vary); for IPRateLimiter,
// one entry per distinct source address (including a single one-shot
// spoofed UDP packet, which by construction is never seen from the same
// address twice). An attacker who can cheaply vary that identity on every
// attempt could otherwise grow this map's memory usage without bound, one
// entry per attempt, forever. Sweeping at most once per window keeps
// memory instead bounded by "how many distinct keys were active in

// sustained traffic rate -- an ordinary, expected property of a rate
