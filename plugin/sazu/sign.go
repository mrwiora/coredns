// SignZoneContent produces an RFC 4034 RRSIG for every RRset in rrs
// (grouped by owner name + type), signed with signer -- SAZU's original,
// still-default single-key model (§9.1): the one key that authenticates
// a push over SIG(0) is the same key that signs the zone content itself,
// so there is no separate DNSSEC signing step or key to manage. The
// DNSKEY RRset gets signed exactly the same way as everything else here
// (a self-signature, since it's just another RRset in rrs), which is why
// this single-key model doesn't need a KSK/ZSK split to produce a
// validly self-signed DNSKEY RRset. A zone that registers an optional
// ZSK (see keys.go) instead uses SignZoneContentSplit, below; this
// function is simply that one called with the same key on both sides,
// preserved as its own entry point so every existing single-key caller
// and test is completely unaffected by the ZSK addition.
//
// Returns rrs unchanged plus one RRSIG per distinct (name, type) group,
// in the order those groups first appeared. Pass a signer/dnskeyRR pair
// that actually match (dnskeyRR.KeyTag() must equal what signer will
// produce) -- this function does not check that itself; VerifySignedRRsets
// is what a receiver uses to confirm it.

// ordinary zone content. Passing the same key/signer pair for both
// reproduces SignZoneContent's original behavior exactly (byte-for-byte:
// it's the same code path with the same key on both sides), which is
// what SignZoneContent itself now does. rrs need not actually contain a
